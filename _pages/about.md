<!-- <span style="color:#145094"><b>Learn from the brain, but shall not be limited to.</b></span> The research of artificial intelligence has been inferenced dramatically by neuroscience, such as the representation of visual stimuli [1, 2] and visual attention [3, 4]. On the other hand, given that one of the ultimate goals of artificial intelligence is to exceed the human ability [5], modern computer algorithms do not necessarily have to mimic the brain [6]. Thus, our research philosophy is to incorporate biological knowledge into a computer algorithm whenever suitable, but not be bound to it.

<span style="color:#145094"><b>Learn from the brain, but not be constrained by it.</b></span> Artificial intelligence research has been profoundly influenced by neuroscience, inspiring advancements in areas such as the representation of visual stimuli [1, 2] and visual attention mechanisms [3, 4]. However, as one of the ultimate goals of AI is to surpass human capabilities [5], modern algorithms do not need to strictly mimic biological processes [6]. Our research philosophy embraces this balance: leveraging biological insights to inform computational algorithms where appropriate, while maintaining the freedom to explore beyond biological constraints.

<!-- # Latest Research
One example of our bio-inspired machine learning is the study of the Sequential Probability Ratio Test, or SPRT [7]. SPRT is originally invented by Abraham Wald, later re-discovered as the algorithm that best explains the primate parietal lobe neurons' activity [8]. The parietal neurons are thought to be engaged in evidence-accumulating processes in complex decision-making. We extended Wald's algorithm to a more general case, using deep neural networks aided by density ratio estimation algorithms [9]. Coined as SPRT-TANDEM, our algorithm showed a competitive speed and accuracy under various real-world scenarios. Interested readers are invited to read the [introductory article on GitHub](https://github.com/Akinori-F-Ebihara/SPRT-TANDEM_what_is_it) and/or the [original paper [10]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05587).

# Latest Research  
A recent example of our bio-inspired machine learning work focuses on the **Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT)** [7]. Originally proposed by Abraham Wald, SPRT was later found to describe the activity of neurons in the primate parietal lobe [8], which are believed to play a role in evidence accumulation during complex decision-making tasks. Building on this foundation, we expanded Wald's algorithm to address more complex scenarios by integrating deep neural networks with advanced density ratio estimation techniques [9]. This extension, **SPRT-TANDEM**, demonstrates competitive speed and accuracy across various real-world applications.

For those interested, we invite you to explore our [introductory article on GitHub](https://github.com/Akinori-F-Ebihara/SPRT-TANDEM_what_is_it) and delve deeper into the [original research paper [10]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05587).
